I\u0026#x27;ve heard people complain many times about how they just want a personal CRM for non-business purposes. On the one hand I love the idea because having such a specific use case allows you to make a very simple UI that does exactly what the user needs.

As someone who has been building a simple CRM for the past ~8 years, I can tell you that everyone wants something different, and if you react to every suggestion you get, your product will end up losing the awesome focus it has right now. That doesn\u0026#x27;t mean you should ignore feedback, it just means you should make sure the feedback is coming from your actual target audience and not some random person who\u0026#x27;s looking for Monica to be something it isn\u0026#x27;t.

According to FanGraphs, teams are shifting at a rate nearly 10 times greater than six years ago\u0026quot;\u003cp\u003eThis should be more prominent and is likely the root cause of guys swinging for homeruns more often. Every hitter will eventually fall into a pattern where they\u0026#x27;re hitting certain pitches to only a certain part of the field. With the increase in data it\u0026#x27;s much easier for teams to recognize these patterns and position their fielders to compensate. So if you made your living hitting line drive basehits to shallow left field, halfway through the season every team will pick up on that and place an extra infielder right in your sweet spot. The same hits that got you through college and into the major leagues are now outs. This has been such a huge change that MLB thought about outlawing defensive shifts (I personally enjoy seeing the constant back and forth of strategy between offensive and defense which has always been a part of the major leagues). The obvious solution like the article mentions comes down to \u0026quot;the one ball that can’t be caught is the one that lands in the seats\u0026quot;.\u003cp\u003eThis is also highly dependent on the type of hitter. If you\u0026#x27;re Yankee\u0026#x27;s 6\u0026#x27;7\u0026quot; right fielder Aaron Judge then swinging for the fences with a higher launch angle makes perfect sense. However, if you\u0026#x27;re Dee Gordon, one of the fastest players in the league who weighs about 175lbs, keeping the ball low is probably still going to result in higher batting and slugging percentages. Guys like Bryce Harper who can hit for power and average do seem to be leaning more towards power, which used to only happen later in their career (ex. Barry Bonds). In my observation, it seems like players such as Dee Gordon are slowly becoming obsolete as teams are prefering the long ball to playing \u0026quot;small ball\u0026quot;. You certainly don\u0026#x27;t see as many teams with a true, stereotypical \u0026quot;leadoff guy\u0026quot; these days and many teams seem stacked with guys who would have been labelled \u0026quot;cleanup hitters\u0026quot; 10 years ago.","time":1496773828,"by":"Lukeas14","id":14499773,"parent":14499255,"comments":[{"kids":[],"text":"I think speed will still be valuable as stolen bases continue to decrease across the league, as long as those hitters can still get on base at a .320+ clip.
